# GDInterpolation
Gradient Descent (GD) interpolation is used for optimizing parameters in models, such as polynomial fitting, to best represent data points. By defining a loss function and iteratively updating parameters, you can minimize errors and effectively fit models using Python's libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib.
